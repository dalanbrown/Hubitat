So I started from https://github.com/brbeaird/sense-energy-node with the idea that I would try to create some Hubitat native groovy code to allow 
me to look as some of the sense energy monitor https://sense.com/ data in the Hubitat dashboard.

A this point you can ener a username/password, it will create child devices for each monitored device and will update the dashboard dynamically 
until the web socket disconnects. 

I am still getting my head around how this is supposed to work - when to reconnect for example.

So much still to do...
